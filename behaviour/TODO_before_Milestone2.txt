TODO:
    Add function STOP_STRAIGHT which stops straight movement by moving in the opposite direction for 0.5 seconds
    Same style as STOP_ROTATE.

    Calibrate VARIABLES in utilities.py

    Calibrate the cather area. The following two lines in planner.py (Currently, line 12 and 13)
        self._world.our_defender._receiving_area = {'width': 30, 'height': 30, 'front_offset': 12} # 10
        self._world.our_attacker._receiving_area = {'width': 30, 'height': 30, 'front_offset': 14}

    Possible issue, if the robot accidentally kicks the ball before grabbing it, he is screwed

    Grabbing, kicking and passing was tested for both kicker and attacker using the testCommunications.
    Need to test it properly with the robot.
